# Summary
We present an efficient implementation of the Generalized Green's function Cluster Expansion (GGCE), a new method for computing the properties of electron-phonon Hamiltonians in the single-carrier (polaron) limit. The GGCE can handle almost any electron-phonon coupling linear in phonon displacement, including the Holstein, Peierls and multi-phonon mode couplings. In addition, it is capable of finite-temperature calculations and can be deployed at scale using the PETSc sparse matrix solver engine.

# Statement of need
The electron-phonon problem is of both fundamental relevance and practical importance in materials science [@ephReview1; @ephReview2]. Electron-phonon interactions promote a variety of novel states, low-temperature phases and high-temperature transport phenomena in quantum materials, and are essential to the understanding of the behavior of solar cells [@solarcells] and semiconductors [@semiconductors]. In the dilute-carrier-density limit, electron-phonon coupling gives rise to quasiparticles called polarons whose properties encode the physics of materials spanning the full range of low to high temperatures. Current reasearch on polarons is broadly divided into two themes: fundamental research carried out in theoretical physics departments and applied research in applied physics and materials science departments. The former focuses on the many-body aspects of the polaron problem [@Mahan; @MA], while the latter focuses on the materials and _ab initio_ calculations [@Giustino]. The two, however, cannot be separated.

This paper summarizes a new scientific software that bridges this gap. It allows for the treatment of polaron statics and dynamics in models of electron-phonon coupling of almost arbitary form. It presents a self-contained first step towards an ongoing effort to combine _ab initio_ understanding of materials and exact many-body analysis of polaron states. The software allows for a _numerically exact_ computation of both the ground-state and spectral response of polaron systems described by arbitary electron density and/or hopping phonon coupling [@carbone2021numerically].


# Software summary

Our software, Python software package called the Generalized Green's Function Cluster Expansion (GGCE), is designed to compute fundamental properties of polarons in electron-phonon Hamiltonians. The software is built on the Momentum Average family of methods and details on the theoretical framework can be found in Carbone _et al_ [@carbone2021numerically; @carbone2021bond].

The primary objective of GGCE is to solve for the Green's function of the polaronic system. Once the Green's function is solved for, other quantities can be easily derived with minimal additional computation. This is performed via continued application of the Dyson identity, which generates a hierarchy of auxiliary equations of motion which are truncated at some level of theory. The GGCE level of theory is completely controlled by two parameters: the maximum number of phonons allowed on a chain, and the maximum extent of that phonon cloud.

The GGCE code consists of three components detailed in our documentation: models, systems and solvers.

- Models completely describe the Hamiltonian system to solve, and the level of theory at which to solve it;
- Systems construct all of the objects required to build the matrix to solve;
- Solvers utilize different back-ends to actually solve the constructed matrix in an efficient manner.

## Models

The choice of model completely defines the type of electron-phonon coupling used in the Hamiltonian. Every model Hamiltonian assumes nearest-neighbor hopping of the electron, and Einstein phonons (phonon dispersion is constant). The user can control the electron hopping strength and the phonon frequency in addition to the type of coupling. Currently, we have implemented the Holstein, Peierls, Bond-Peierls and Edwards Fermion Boson models (as well as any arbitrary combination of these). The details of the implementation can be found at `ggce.model.py`.

## Systems

The Systems are a helpful intermediary for performing the sometimes expensive step of constructing the Python objects required for building matrices.

## Solvers

At the heart of the GGCE engine are the solvers, which are as simple as NumPy's dense solver or SciPy's sparse solver, and as powerful as the massively parallel PESTc sparse solver engine. GGCE is MPI enabled, and allows for a variety of parallelization schemes, all of which are detailed in our documentation.
