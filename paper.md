# Summary

The electron-phonon interaction is of pivotal importance both for the theoretical understanding of key physical phenomena e.g. superconductivty, and for targeted new materials design. Our proposed software solves lattice model Hamiltonians, toy systems which capture these physics, in a numerically exact fashion. It is fully documented and tested, open source and can be used either for fast benchmarking, or for massively parallel high-performance calculations in challenging parameter regimes.
